# Birth-Weight-Prediction
A Jupyter Notebook to predict a baby's birth weight.

### Purpose: 
- <b> Babies who are underweight can have complications (low birth weight): </b> Underweight is less than 5 lbs, 8 ounces.  It is usually caused by being born too early (premature). Complications for being underweight include short term / long term complications like low oxygen levels at birth, breathing problems, nervous system problems, digestive problems, developmental delays. 
- <b> Babies who are overweight can cause problems for the mother: </b> over 8 lbs, 13 ounces at birth. For the mother, it increases the need of a c-section, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, asthma and obesity. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could have problems with breathing, low glucose levels and jaundice.
